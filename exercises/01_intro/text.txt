In descriptive writing, the author does not tell the reader what was seen, felt, tested, smelled, or heard.  Rather, he describes something that he experienced and, through his choice of words, makes it seem real. In other words, descriptive writing is vivid, colorful, and detailed. Descriptive writing creates an impression in the readerâ€™s mind of an event, a place, a person, or thing. The writing will be such that it will set a mood or describe something in such detail that if the reader saw it, they would recognize it. Descriptive writing will bring words to life and makes the text interesting.
